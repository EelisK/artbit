## Setup

To use this project, you need to have a RabbitMQ instance running.
You can configure the connection details using environment variables.

This can be eachieved by creating a `.env` file with the following contents:

```
export RMQ_HOST="your-rmq-instance"
export RMQ_PORT="your-rmq-port"
export RMQ_VHOST="your-rmq-vhost"
export RMQ_USERNAME="your-rmq-username"
export RMQ_PASSWORD="your-rmq-password"
```

## Usage

Development can be done by running the server and client in separate terminals.

```bash
# Start the server
(source .env && python -m server)
# Start the client
(source .env && python -m client)
```

For a production setup, you can use the provided setup script.
This will create a systemd service for the server and client that will start on boot.

```bash
# Setup the server
./scripts/setup-service.sh server
# Setup the client
./scripts/setup-service.sh client
```
